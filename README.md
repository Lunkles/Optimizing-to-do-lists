# [Optimizing Simple Programs]

For people with complex data management needs, I hope to create a system allowing for greater potential complexity that maintains the functional simplicity of its modern-day competitors.

My goal is essentially to take the best of existing task/information storage systems and make them more customizable while also keeping their functional simplicity, which would be usable for all people rather than just picking and choosing a way of storing information based on personal preferences.
